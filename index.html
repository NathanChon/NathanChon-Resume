        <div class="subheading mb-5">Registered NurseðŸš‘</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello I am Nathan Chon, a graduated senior of UCR that has finished the biology program. As a past student at UCR I have had the opportunity to meet and converse with many people. As a graduating student of UCR I have found that I have acquired many skills that suit my future job. As a student I have been able to take on a multitude of roles and have been able to grow in my passion as these 4 years of college have flown by. The experience that I have gained has come from many hours of volunteer work where I had aided in the lives of children who sought to gain knowledge. With the countless hours I have put in I have found to have great skills that attribute to my personality. My many talents that aided me in my hours of community service was my ability to personally adapt to each child as well as teach them in the most efficient way creating lessons that impacted each child to their strengths while also focusing on their weaknesses. <br><br>

        As a trained teacher I was given the opportunity to instruct students with precise precision. Following all directions given while additionally putting my own inside spin on each class. Each lesson was tailored to a student as was previously stated but additionally aided in their full understanding. Pursuing my end goal of being a Registered Nurse I have had the opportunity to gain small experience from every chance I have had. As a new incoming nurse I was given the ability to work with my father under his wing. With my father being a contractor I was able to follow precise directions and was able to work thoroughly as an assistant to my fathers business. <br><br>

        As an assistant I was given the opportunity to have hands-on work experience in the field with other coworkers to remodel a wonderful home. With this work experience I was given the opportunity to see how facilities work and how one can take the time to work together well with one another. Being a full time student with volunteering on the side i had top properl;y manage my time in order to keep my grades up as well as work to my best capability inorder to show my true potential at every job I had to do. As a full time student I also took some time to join a club and become an officer within a Korean-Amercian Christian Missions club. This club aided in the funding of missionaries to go into other parts of less fortunate parts of the country and which showed grace to those who they had helped. As a result, I have had many opportunities to serve in my community as well as work for those who were close to me in order to grow my community better and better prepare myself for my future job as a nursing student. With this new found knowledge I have better prepared myself for the future and have been given  a better understanding of how I can better serve my patients as I enter this new field.
